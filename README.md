# Blog Web Application

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a simple blog web application using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS**. This application will enable users to create and view blog posts. Note that posts will not persist between sessions as no database is used in this version. Emphasis will be placed on styling to ensure a pleasant user experience.

## Deliverables

- **Node.js Project:** A functional web application built with Node.js and Express.js.
- **EJS Template:** At least one EJS file for the structure of the website.
- **CSS Styling:** At least one CSS file for styling the website.

## Features

1. **Post Creation:** Users can create new blog posts.
2. **Post Viewing:** The home page displays all blog posts.
3. **Post Update/Delete:** Users can edit and delete posts as needed.
4. **Styling:** The application is well-styled and responsive, providing a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Node.js & Express.js:** The web server will be built using Node.js and Express.js, with Express.js handling routing and middleware.
2. **EJS:** EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
